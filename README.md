## Development Progress

I've been working on this close to a year. There is one chapter play through with about 4-5 different endings. This is titled FIRSTWORLD. I just begun work on the second world. Where you meet the wizard and are going to aquire spell powers for when you're battling enemies.

#### Includes Now..
- Diverse story with multiple endings where you can play as 5 different races.
- Battle System, Karma System, Bag system.
- A Help book, you can acquire in you play the game carefully.
- Events that trigger stat affects, battles, or picking up key items.
- One ending that is pretty difficult to get in order to progress story.
- Original Music and painted assets.
- RPG awesome.
- improved secondary Bag UI

#### Adding Features/Bug Fixes coming Soon...
- Save feature with local storage.
- World 2 (once you're out of the town you can get past the wizard's hut)
- deployment.
- fixing up the taunt aspect of battle system (sometimes taunting leads to a negative attack stat which makes the character die).
- fixing some UI.
- fixing the block aspect or when the player heals mid battle, they sometimes go past their max HP.

## How To Win

Don't die. This can be from an event, dying in battle, or your karma falling too low. You know you have won when you escape the village.
